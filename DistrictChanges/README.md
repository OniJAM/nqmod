## Version 1.
Building yields halved and rounded up for all buildings in campus, commercial, industrial, holy and theater districts.


Buildings now give a percent bonus yield for all buildings in campus, commercial, industrial, holy and theater districts.


Buildings now provide up to 6 citizen slots to work for buildings in campus, commercial, industrial holy, and theater districts.


Working a citizen slot now provides +1 more of the yield type from that district.
